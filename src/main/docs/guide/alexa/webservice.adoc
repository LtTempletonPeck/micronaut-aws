Micronaut simplifies https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/custom-skills/host-a-custom-skill-as-a-web-service.html[hosting a Custom Skill as a Web Service].

The `micronaut-aws-webservice` is a fork of Amazon Servlet module. It allow you to run your Alexa Skill backend logic in Micronaut applications deployed with a netty or servlet runtimes.

Just by including the dependency:

dependency:micronaut-aws-alexa-httpserver[groupId="io.micronaut.aws"]

you get an POST endpoint at `/alexa` (the route is configurable via `alexa.endpoint.path`.

You can configure your Skill's endpoint under `Build/Endpoint` in the Alexa developer console.
