To use the https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java-v2[AWS SDK v2], add the following dependency:

dependency:micronaut-aws-sdk-v2[groupId="io.micronaut.aws"]

By default, Micronaut configures a `SdkHttpClient` instance based on the JVMâ€™s lightweight `URLConnection`. It can be
configured with the following properties:

include::{includedir}configurationProperties/io.micronaut.aws.sdk.v2.client.UrlConnectionClientConfiguration.adoc[]

You can also use more powerful, but also slower to startup clients. By default, if any of them are in the classpath,
then the `URLConnection` one will not be configured. You can override this behaviour by setting the following JVM system
properties:

* `software.amazon.awssdk.http.service.impl`. Possible values:
** `software.amazon.awssdk.http.urlconnection.UrlConnectionSdkHttpService` for the `URLConnection` based client.
** `software.amazon.awssdk.http.apache.ApacheSdkHttpService` for the Apache HTTP client (if in the classpath).
* `software.amazon.awssdk.http.async.service.impl`. Possible values:
** `software.amazon.awssdk.http.nio.netty.NettySdkAsyncHttpService` for the Netty client (if in the classpath).

## Apache HTTP client

To use the Apache HTTP sync client, add the following dependency:

dependency:apache-client[groupId="software.amazon.awssdk"]

The Apache HTTP client can be configured with the following options:

include::{includedir}configurationProperties/io.micronaut.aws.sdk.v2.client.apache.ApacheClientConfiguration.adoc[]

## Netty client

To use the Netty async client, add the following dependency:

dependency:netty-nio-client[groupId="software.amazon.awssdk"]

The Netty client can be configured with the following options:

include::{includedir}configurationProperties/io.micronaut.aws.sdk.v2.client.netty.NettyClientConfiguration.adoc[]

## Supplying AWS credentials

By default, AWS SDK v2 will attempt to find AWS credentials from the following places:

1. Java system properties: `aws.accessKeyId` and `aws.secretAccessKey`.
2. Environment variables: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.
3. The default credential profiles file: `~/.aws/credentials`.
4. Amazon ECS container credentials, loaded from Amazon ECS if the environment variable
   `AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI` is set.
5. Instance profile credentials, used on Amazon EC2 instances, and delivered through the Amazon EC2 metadata service.

For more information, check https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v2/developer-guide/credentials.html[the AWS documentation].

If you still want to specify the credentials via configuration, you can do so in `application.yml`:

[source,yaml]
----
aws:
  accessKeyId: your_access_key_id_here
  secretKey: your_secret_key_id_here
  sessionToken: your_session_token_here
----

## AWS region selection

By default, AWS SDK v2 will attempt to determine the AWS region in the following ways:

1. Environment variable: `AWS_REGION`.
2. The default shared configuration file: `~/.aws/config`.
3. Amazon EC2 instance metadata service.

For more information, check https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v2/developer-guide/java-dg-region-selection.html[the AWS documentation].

If you still want to specify the region via configuration, you can do so in `application.yml`:

[source,yaml]
----
aws:
  region: eu-west-1
----
